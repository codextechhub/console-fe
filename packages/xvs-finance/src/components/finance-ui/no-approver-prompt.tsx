// <useNoApproverPrompt> - warn at submission when nobody can approve what was
// just submitted, and offer to continue anyway.
//
// A workflow stage that resolves to nobody activates with an empty approver
// snapshot, and the document *parks*: submitted, waiting, and with no human
// able to move it. Without this the submit looks like it worked and the
// document quietly sits there. Every submit-for-approval endpoint now returns
// an `approval` block saying whether that happened; pass it here.
//
// Nothing in this file assumes *how* a stage picks its approvers. The backend
// sends a ready-made `requirement` sentence describing what would staff it, and
// that design has now been through one real migration: permission keys were
// replaced by roles, groups, document-driven rules and organogram seats, and
// the only thing here that needed touching was the optional key chip. The
// sentence carried every other case unchanged.
//
// The dialog is deliberately blunt about the trade. Continuing takes the
// document to its terminal state with no second pair of eyes, which on a payout
// or a purchase order is the entire maker-checker control, so the copy says so
// rather than reading like a routine confirmation. The backend records who
// continued and refuses the release outright if anybody can still decide the
// stage, so a dialog left open while an approver is appointed cannot bypass
// them.
//
//   const { promptIfParked, noApproverDialog } = useNoApproverPrompt();
//   const res = await submitForApproval(...).unwrap();
