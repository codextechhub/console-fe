## Holistic problem solving

When the user asks for a problem to be fixed, trace it to its root cause and
fix the shared source of the failure where practical. Review adjacent flows,
callers, and equivalent modules for the same failure mode; do not stop at a
one-off patch that only hides the reported symptom. Keep the work within the
requested scope, preserve established behaviour, and add regression coverage
at the lowest shared boundary so future instances are prevented.

## Verification follows the current change

Verification is triggered by work performed in the **current request**, not by
pre-existing changes in the worktree or work completed in an earlier request.

- Git-only and read-only requests - for example inspect, explain, diagnose,
  stage, commit, branch, push, or report status - do not authorize rerunning
  tests, builds, `/verify-design`, or responsive audits unless the user
  explicitly asks for them.
- If the current request changes no code, do not run tests or builds merely for
  reassurance. Use only the read-only checks needed to complete the request.
- If the current request changes code but does not change a screen or visual
  behaviour, run only proportionate code checks. Do not run `/verify-design` or
  responsive visual verification.
- Run screen/design verification only when the current request actually creates
  or changes a user-visible screen, layout, interaction, or responsive behaviour,
  or when the user explicitly requests visual verification.

## How-to guide alignment

`docs/HOW_TO_GUIDE_MASTER_PLAN.md` is the canonical plan and coverage contract for
the Console how-to system. For every product change, inspect whether it changes a
route, label, permission, prerequisite, field, action, status, validation rule,
confirmation, result, error recovery, workflow order, screenshot, contextual-help
mapping, search alias, support handoff, walkthrough target, or walkthrough branch.

When guide impact exists, update the affected guide registry record, article,
screenshots, contextual mappings, search metadata, walkthrough definition or stable
`data-guide` targets, tests, review date, and coverage ledger in the same change as
applicable. New user-visible workflows require a discoverable guide. Complex or
high-risk workflows require an interactive walkthrough unless the coverage ledger
records why one would be unsafe or unhelpful.

Walkthroughs may explain and highlight consequential actions, but must never
auto-submit financial postings, approvals, payments, imports, invitations,
permission changes, proxy sessions, or destructive actions. They must not bypass
authorization, validation, confirmation, or tenant scoping.

If a completed product change has no guide impact, say `Guide impact: none` with a
brief reason in the final summary. Documentation-only and Git-only requests do not
require this statement.

## Pre-ship review (`ship-check`)

When I say **`ship-check`** (or "run the ship-check") on a change, answer these
four questions about the code you just wrote - honestly and specifically, not as
a rubber stamp. Point at real files/lines, name concrete risks, and if the answer
to 1 or 2 is "no", say so and propose the fix. Don't claim "secure/efficient"
without naming *what* makes it so.

1. **Did you build this in the most secure way?**
   - Authz on every new endpoint/screen (RBAC key gates the *backend* view, not
     just the FE nav). Entity/tenant scoping - can a user read/write another
     tenant's rows by changing an id or `?entity=`?
   - What does the serializer/response expose? Flag raw `JSONField`/metadata,
     PII, secrets, internal ids that didn't need to leave the server.
   - Input validation and injection surface; never trust FE-only gating.

2. **Did you build this in the most efficient way?**
   - Query cost: N+1 (`select_related`/`prefetch_related`), missing indexes,
     unbounded result sets, pagination present where lists can grow.
   - Frontend: no request-per-keystroke (debounce search), no unnecessary
     re-renders/broad selectors/polling, no added latency on the hot path.
   - Is there a simpler implementation that does the same job?

3. **What regressions could this introduce?**
   - Permission/nav gating changes (who *loses* visibility?), shared-component
     edits, tag-invalidation changes, contract/shape assumptions, migrations.
   - List the blast radius explicitly; "none" needs justifying.

4. **What tests do we need before we ship it?**
   - Backend: the security-critical cases first - permission-denied (403),
     cross-tenant isolation, then the happy path + each filter/edge.
   - Frontend: empty `{}` / populated / error / forbidden render states; any new
     mutation flow. State whether the screen was actually driven with **real
     data** (`/verify-design`) or only type-checked - empty-state screenshots do
     NOT prove populated rendering.

Finish with a one-line **verdict**: ship / fix-first, and the single most
important thing to do before shipping.

## Wrapping up: report in plain words

When you finish a task - a build, an investigation, a document, a round of
decisions - close with a plain-language breakdown rather than a wall of prose.
Short numbered lines, one point each, ordinary words. Assume I am reading it tired.

Use **only** the sections that actually apply, and **skip the ones that don't** -
an empty heading is worse than no heading, and never pad a section to fill it out.

- **What you now have** - the finished things, one line each. Only if something was
  produced.
- **What you decided** - decisions taken and locked, one line each. Only if
  decisions were actually made.
- **What was fixed** - resolved defects, written in the past tense. Include only
  when knowing the original cause is useful and it has not already been explained.
- **What still needs attention** - only defects, risks, or incomplete work that
  remain after the task. Omit this section entirely when nothing remains.
- **Where to go next** - the order of the next steps, and which of them are
  unblocked right now.

That list is closed. Do not invent a heading for something that does not fit one
of them: put it under the heading it belongs to, and if it belongs under none of
them, leave it out of the breakdown entirely. A section the user did not ask for
is one they must decode before they can tell whether it needs them.

How to write it:

- Plain words beat precise jargon. "Purchases can approve themselves" lands;
  "`skip_if_no_approvers` permits terminal auto-approval" does not.
- Size things honestly in both directions - say when something feared turns out to
  be a one-line fix, and say when something small turns out to be load-bearing.
- Put the worst finding where it cannot be missed, even if that breaks the order.
- Never place resolved problems under a heading that suggests they remain broken.
  When all reported defects were fixed, say so plainly and omit any unresolved-
  findings section.
- Keep file/line references out of the breakdown; they belong in `todo.md` and in
  the detail above it.
- Don't re-explain what I already know from the conversation.

## Asking, suggesting and disputing: use a real example

When you need a decision from the user, **ask the question directly**. Do not bury
it in a paragraph, do not quietly answer it yourself and move on, and do not hand
over a list of considerations in place of the question.

Then **show the consequence with a real example** - named people, a named school,
a specific sequence of events. The example is what makes a choice obvious, so it
is not decoration and it is not optional.

This applies equally to three things:

- **questions** - what needs deciding;
- **suggestions** - something you think should be done;
- **disputes** - something you think is wrong, including a decision already taken.

Write the example the way it would actually happen:

> Bright Star School enrols Tunde and the admin mistypes his mother's address as
> `adaokeye@gmail.com`. That address belongs to a stranger who already has an
> account, because her own daughter attends Greenfield. If an attached link shows
> the full record straight away, she opens her app and sees Tunde's class, his
> fees, his home address and his father's phone number.

Not:

> Attached links may expose PII to an incorrect recipient where the email address
> is mistyped.

The second one is true and nobody can act on it. Abstractions hide the size of a
thing in both directions - they make a small risk sound alarming and a serious one
sound routine. A concrete case is the only way it can be weighed.

Keep it short. One example, the shortest one that still shows the consequence.
Where a choice has two sides, show the bad case **and** the good case, not only
the side you favour.

## Verifying screens
After building or changing a screen **in the current request**, run
`/verify-design` (project skill) to drive it in the real running app and **look
at the screenshots** - build-green ≠ works. Do not invoke it for a later
Git-only, read-only, or commit request that merely encounters those existing
screen changes in the worktree. It scrubs its own test-login rows afterward.

## Responsive views - every screen must work on phone AND desktop

Every screen you build or change must render well at desktop **and** small
widths - a user switching from PC to phone must never get a broken view.
Horizontal page overflow is a bug, full stop.

Build to the house conventions (full list: `docs/FINANCE_BUILD_NOTES.md`
§Responsive - they apply app-wide, not just finance):
- Never remove `grid grid-cols-1 min-w-0` from DashboardLayout's children
  wrapper - it stops nowrap tables stretching pages past the viewport.
- Lists: `DataTable`/`CustomTable` already render phone cards below `md`;
  dense report tables opt out per-table with `mobile="scroll"`.
- Toolbars/action rows get `flex-wrap`; tab strips `max-w-full
  overflow-x-auto` with `whitespace-nowrap` buttons; form grids
  `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-N`; count-KPI strips `grid-cols-2 … lg:grid-cols-4`
  (money KPIs stay 1-col on phones); drawers `w-full sm:max-w-[…]`; fixed side
  rails/sidebars stack below `md` (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[260px_1fr]`).
- In a flex row, a `flex-1` wrapper needs `min-w-0` or descendant `truncate`
  silently stops working.

**Verify, don't assume.** After screen work performed in the current request,
alongside `/verify-design` run the overflow probe:
`cd .claude/skills/verify-design && BASE_URL=<vite-url> ROUTES="/your/routes" node ./_mobile_audit.mjs`
It drives each route logged-in at 390px (phone) and 820px (tablet), screenshots
both, and reports page-level horizontal overflow with the offending elements
(`_net_probe.mjs` does the same for failing network calls). **Look at the phone
screenshots** in `/tmp/verify-design/shots-responsive/` - zero overflow with a
crushed side-by-side layout is still a fail. Desktop remains the design source
of truth; phone adapts (stack, wrap, cards) - never hide or truncate data away.

**Depth policy - phones are view + simple actions, not full parity.** Phone
users browse, read details, approve, and fill simple forms - those flows must
be genuinely good. Complex multi-line creation/editing (journal entry, invoice
lines, receipt allocation, bulk editors) stays desktop-first: on a phone it
must be *usable* (no overflow, nothing broken or unreachable), but don't spend
effort optimizing it or redesigning it phone-first, and never degrade the
desktop experience to make it fit.

## Comments: short inline, the story in the doc block

An inline comment is a label, not an explanation. Keep it to one short line that
names what the next line or block does. If the point takes more than that to
make, it does not belong inline: move it into the JSDoc block (`/** ... */`)
above the component, hook, function, type or slice it concerns, or into a block
at the top of the file when it describes the file as a whole.

The doc block is where the reasoning lives. Write it there once, properly, and
let the code below stay clean.

### Write for a stranger reading it years from now

Every comment and doc block is permanent documentation. It has to read the same
way to somebody who has never seen this branch, this milestone or this
conversation. Describe the code as it is, in the present tense, and let it
stand on its own.

That rules out:

- milestone, sprint, wave and ticket names - `M16`, `wave 3`, `the RBAC sprint`;
- change narration - "added", "changed", "moved here", "now returns", "used to";
- notes aimed at a reviewer - "note that", "as discussed", "for now",
  "temporary until we", "so you can see it working";
- time references - "recently", "since the redesign", "will be removed later".

Not this:

```tsx
// M16 flag added here so the preview tab shows up for Corona
const canPreview = useFeatureFlag("notification_preview");
```

This:

```tsx
/**
 * Template preview panel.
 *
 * Branding and locale resolve from the active tenant rather than from the
 * signed-in user, so an admin checking a template sees what the recipient
 * will see.
 */
export function TemplatePreview({ template }: TemplatePreviewProps) {
  const canPreview = useFeatureFlag("notification_preview");
```

The second version says more, and it stays true and useful long after the
milestone that prompted it is forgotten.

### What a doc block should carry

Say what the thing is for, and what a caller needs to know that the signature
and prop types do not already tell them: the invariant it keeps, the scope it
applies to, the condition that makes it render or behave differently, the reason
behind a choice that looks odd. Do not restate the props in prose, and do not
turn the doc block into a history of the file.

This applies to every comment written anywhere in the codebase, tests included,
and to every comment already sitting beside code being changed: bring it up to
this standard rather than leaving it as found.

## Writing punctuation

Do not use em dashes (Unicode U+2014) anywhere in source code, comments,
documentation, tests, or user-facing copy. Use a comma, colon, parentheses, or
an ordinary hyphen (`-`), whichever reads most naturally.

## Vocabulary: it is a **branch**, never a campus

A school site is a **branch**. That is the word the data model uses
(`Branch`, `branch_id`, `branch__isnull=True`), the word the API returns
(`branch`, `branch_name`, `scope_label`), and the word the product uses on
screen.

Never write "campus" - not in UI copy, not in comments, not in variable names,
not in commit messages, not in docs. A design prototype or a mockup that says
"campus" is using the wrong word: translate it to branch as you build. The same
goes for "site" and "location" when a branch is meant.

| Say | Not |
| --- | --- |
| Ikeja Branch | Ikeja Campus |
| All branches | All campuses |
| School-wide | Applies to the whole school (fine), "every campus" (not) |
| This branch runs the class | This campus runs the class |
| Branch admin | Campus admin |

The one exception is quoted third-party text - an error message from an
external system, or a school's own words in a support ticket. Quote those
verbatim and do not silently correct them.
