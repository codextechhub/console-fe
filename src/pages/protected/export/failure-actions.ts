// What a person can actually DO about each failure and omission.
//
// The backend already supplies a user-safe message and a recommended action in
// words. This adds the missing half: which of those recommendations the UI can
// turn into a button, and which are genuinely out-of-band.
//
// The distinction that matters is retry. Only a transient infrastructure fault
// is worth retrying - a filter, permission, row-cap or date-span failure fails
// again identically, so offering Retry there wastes a wait and teaches people
// the button does not work. The API enforces this too (`failure.retryable`);
// this map is what decides which button appears in its place.
