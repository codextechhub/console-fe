// Whether an AR adjustment posts straight to the ledger or has to be approved.
//
// The rule is not the same for all four documents, and that asymmetry is the whole
// point. A refund moves cash out and a write-off concedes income, so both need a
// second person at any size. A concession or a credit note gives revenue away, so
// both need one **at or above the tenant's adjustment threshold** (₦50,000 by
// default) and post directly below it.
//
// So one concession form behaves two ways, and the person filling it in has to know
// which before they commit - not at submit time, when they have already written the
// reason and picked the invoice.
//
// Two sources, deliberately kept apart:
//
//   * **The server's `approval_required`** decides what actually happens. It is on
//     every adjustment read, it is computed by the same function the post endpoint
//     calls, and it can never disagree with the refusal.
//   * **The threshold read off the workflow template** only powers the *label*, on a
//     form whose document does not exist yet and therefore has no server answer.
//
// Never act on the predicted one. If the two disagree the server is right, and the
// screen should follow it rather than argue.
