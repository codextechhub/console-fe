// The active entity's posting window - which dates a document may carry.
//
// Every document date in Finance and Procurement ends up at the same backend
// guard: `ensure_period_open` rejects a date outside an OPEN fiscal period with a
// 409. Without this, a user fills a whole drawer and only then learns the date was
// never allowed. Read this hook, feed `ranges` to <PostingDateField>, and the
// calendar stops offering those days at all.
//
// Degrades open on purpose: if the window can't be read (no entity yet, a 403, the
// network), `constrained` is false and every date stays selectable. A permission
// gap must never lock someone out of a form - the backend guard is still there.
