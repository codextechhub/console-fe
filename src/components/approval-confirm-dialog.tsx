 * from any of them - including the finance screens this app renders out of
 * @xvs/finance and does not own.
 *
 * The reason is required. Posting a credit note that nobody approved is a thing
 * the business may legitimately need to do and is also the shape of every quiet
 * loss: the record has to say who decided and why, or the audit entry is a
 * timestamp with nothing behind it. That entry is written server-side, so a
 * reason typed here is the only part a person supplies.
