/**
 * auth-errors — turn a backend/RTK-Query error into a clear, user-facing
 * sentence for the console (Codex staff intranet) auth pages.
 *
 * The backend (apps/core/response.error_response) returns:
 *   { success: false, message: string, error: {...}, code?: string }
 * where `error` may carry a machine `code` / `error_code` (SCREAMING_SNAKE),
 * a human `detail`, or field errors. RTK-Query wraps HTTP failures as
 * `{ status: number, data: <body> }` and transport failures as
 * `{ status: "FETCH_ERROR" | "TIMEOUT_ERROR" | "PARSING_ERROR", error: string }`.
 *
 * Contract: `humanizeAuthError` NEVER returns a raw SCREAMING_SNAKE code. It
 * maps known codes to copy, lets a backend `detail`/`message` through ONLY when
 * it is a real human sentence (never a code), and otherwise returns `fallback`.
 *
 * The code map below mirrors what the staff auth flows actually emit
 * (vs_user: services/auth.py, services/password.py, services/invitation.py,
 * views/auth.py). Codes that only fire on protected (post-login) routes — e.g.
 * TOKEN_* on the refresh endpoint — are intentionally kept too, since a stale
 * link can still surface them on an auth page.
